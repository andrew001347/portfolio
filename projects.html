        <h2>Tools: Kotlin</h2>
    
        <h2>Design Process</h2>
    
        <h3>01: Ideation</h3>
        <p><strong>Why?</strong> The idea for News Radar is designed to tackle the challenges of online searches. Finding specific
             topics can be difficult without precise queries and the ability to omit irrelevant terms. The goal is to simplify the 
             process of searching and streamline it, making it easier and more efficient to find exactly what you're looking for.
            </p>
    
        <h3>02: Goals</h3>
    
        <h4>Wireframing</h4>
        <p>The most important aspect of creating products using the agile methodology is prioritizing the development and delivery 
            of Minimum Viable Products (MVPs). An MVP includes only the core features necessary to address the primary needs of 
            users, allowing teams to quickly release a functional version of the product. This approach enables rapid feedback 
            collection, iterative improvements, and efficient resource use. By focusing on MVPs, we can validate ideas, adapt to 
            changing requirements, and ensure that the product evolves in alignment with user needs.
        </p>
        <p>Below is a very rough draft on how News Radar would look like.</p>
        <img src="mobile.jpg" alt="Rough Draft of News Radar Wireframing" width="1200" height="700">
        <h3>03: Building and Testing</h3>
    
        <h4>Product Testing</h4>
        <p>Once we developed our MVP, we immediately proceeded to testing, including both dogfooding (where we, as developers, used 
            the app ourselves) and user testing. A frequent challenge encountered during both self-testing and user testing was the 
            difficulty in reversing actions. This prompted us to create a cancel button as well as a pop-up to alert users of the 
            actions they are performing. During user testing, I found that many users struggled to navigate through the app, 
            indicating the need for an improved information architecture (IA).
        </p>
        <p>To address this, we analyzed the IA of existing successful news applications and used these insights to restructure our 
            own app. Additionally, we rearranged and enlarged the icons to ensure that users could easily see and recognize them. 
            Our workflow involved building a feature, testing it ourselves and with users, and then revising any flaws. We repeated 
            this process continuously to ensure optimal performance and usability.
        </p>
    
        <h3>04: Publishing the App</h3>
    

        <h1>SyncSchedule</h1>
        <p>SyncSchedule is a scheduling platform designed to streamline the coordination of events and appointments with ease and 
            efficiency. Users are able to personalize their calendars to organize tasks and commitments. Users can not only manage 
            their schedules but also collaborate effectively with others. An integrated chat system enables direct communication 
            within the platform, facilitating real-time discussions and coordination among team members or group participants.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
    
        <h3>01: Ideation</h3>
        <p><strong>Why?</strong> Imagine this scenario: You create a group chat to organize a hangout and ask your friends if they 
            are available this coming weekend. However, not everyone reads the message at the same time, resulting in delayed 
            replies. As you try to gather everyone's responses, you keep a mental note of everyone's availability and try to 
            coordinate appropriate time slots. Due to the delayed replies, it becomes difficult to get a clear grasp of what time 
            works for everyone.</p>
        <p>Soon, friends start typing out their availability or suggesting times that work for them, and the planning stage becomes 
            increasingly complicated. The process stalls because coordinating a suitable time for everyone becomes too challenging.
             Unfortunately, this delay can lead to the event being canceled altogether. So how do we bring order in this chaos?
            </p>

        <p>If there’s anything that the majority of the population uses, it’s social media and online calendars. Research shows 
            that about 70% of adults use some sort of online calendar to organize their lives. So why not combine the two to 
            streamline where you have a shared calendar system and you can view each other's schedule.
        </p>
    
        <h3>02: Research</h3>
        <h4>Market Research</h4>
        <p>The most important thing to recognize when building applications is to solve user pain points. This involves 
            understanding the challenges and frustrations users face and designing solutions to address these issues effectively.
             By focusing on user pain points, we can create applications that provide real value, enhance user satisfaction, and 
             improve overall user experience. To gain insight into user needs, interviews were conducted with club presidents and
              everyday students. This approach ensured a comprehensive understanding of diverse perspectives and requirements, 
              informing the development process with valuable, user-centered feedback. Some of the sample interview questions were:
            </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What tools or platforms do you currently use to manage your club’s activities?</li>
            <li>What is the biggest problem you would say in organizing large group events?</li>
            <li>How do you notify members of the club about where your meetings are held?</li>
            <li>How do you promote your events to ensure high participation?</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>03: Building and Testing</h3>
        <h4>Dogfooding Testing Practice</h4>
        <p>With the research done, my team and I had a solid understanding of how we wanted our application to turn out. This project
             underwent primarily developer testing with limited user testing involved. However, we also utilized heuristic evaluation to 
             refine our layout and design of the application. This process included several heuristic principles to enhance usability and 
             user experience.</p>
        <p>For instance, we ensured that the chat system adapted seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent 
            user experience across platforms. Additionally, we implemented a pop-up/alert system that notifies users when they are about 
            to perform actions that might significantly change the UI, such as deleting data or navigating away from a form without saving. 
            We also followed heuristic principles by maintaining a consistent color scheme for buttons throughout the application, using red 
            for cancel buttons to ensure they are easily distinguishable and recognizable by users.
        </p>
        <p>Furthermore, we integrated features to anticipate and prevent user errors, such as validation checks on forms to ensure that 
            users enter valid login data, thereby minimizing the likelihood of errors during interactions. Moreover, we provided users 
            with ample control over their actions within the application, including an undo feature for actions such as deleting items, 
            and pop-ups/alerts to notify users when they were about to change the UI, allowing them to easily revert accidental changes.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, we maintained consistent terminology, icons, and design patterns across the application, adhering to established 
            industry standards and best practices. Through these heuristic principles, we aimed to create an intuitive and user-friendly 
            application that enhances the overall user experience and satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>Once we initiated user testing, some users appreciated the idea of a shared calendar system but were concerned about sharing 
            their entire schedule. With privacy in mind, we modified the app to allow users to selectively share events while keeping 
            other events private or restricted to specific people. This approach addressed privacy concerns while maintaining the 
            functionality of the shared calendar system. With these changes and tests, SyncSchedule was officially launched.
        </p>
    
        <h3>04: Final Product</h3>
        <h4>Outcome and Thoughts</h4>
        <p>Overall, I am very pleased with the outcome of SyncSchedule. It was designed to solve a common problem many encounter when 
            planning group activities. The project provided me with exposure to key UI/UX principles and introduced me to new developer 
            methodologies like Agile and Waterfall. Through this experience, I gained practical knowledge in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. 
            Moreover, SyncSchedule afforded me valuable leadership opportunities, enabling me to organize tasks and meetings effectively,
             and giving me a comprehensive understanding of web development.
